The first day I had a basic upset stomach, the next day it was worse, the 3rd day I vommited within 20 minutes of taking it.  Perhaps taking it with food would have helped, but the directions specifically say to take 'between' meals and based on the research I did, it has to be taken on an empty stomach to be absorbed.

5,excellent at relieving stress,"this was recommended initially by an employee at a health food store.  he recommended taking 3 tablets in the AM and 3 at bed-time.  while this is probably overkill, and may not be recommended by true health care professionals, it works for me in improving my  mood and sense of well-being.  for safety, i recommend following the instructions on the Mega Stress 100 label, and of course following your health care professional's advice before taking any supplements.  however, the solution i outlined above has worked for me with great results.  granted, it can get expensive, which is why i chose to purchase the product from amazon instead of a local vendor with high overhead costs.

After trying the product, I can say it does strenghten the nails and makes them healthier, but it will take about a month -- or more -- before you see any improvement.  It's expensive, but shop around.  I have not compared it's effectiveness to the biotin vitamin supplement, but the vitamin supplements seem to be a much larger tablet for the same dose or you may have to take several tablets to equal their dose.

I had previously tried other supplements, creams and polishes.  You name it, I probably have tried it.  My nails aren't super strong but they are long and not splitting or peeling.

5,Stronger Hair Too,"For my 17 year old daughter. This is her second box, and she actually got it for her hair. Her friend said that while it didn't happen overnight ...her friends hair grew stronger and longer.<br />My daughter's hair is fried from the 'flat iron'. And though she's used quality products on the outside of her hair, I've always read that good hair begins ""inside"" the scalp and body. As a normal teenager, she doesn't have the best of diets. I do what I can about the vegetables and fruits, but you know how that goes.<br />Could be our imagination, but her hair DOES seem a bit thicker, not as much breakage, and definitely looks smoother. Her nails are most definitely not 'peeling' and thin.<br />Received the product super fast and in mint condition. There are flat foil packets in the box. Each packet has about a months worth of pills and the days of the week are marked at the top of each packet. You 'punch' the pill out through the foil on the back of the packet.<br />Could I get a $4.00 bottle of plain Biotin at the drugstore? Sure. But she carries the little flat foil packet in her wallet which is convenient. And packaged this way makes them more 'special' in her mind, so she remembers to take them. Unlike her vitamins.",B000EBOOSO,B000EBOOSO,AFN3SHYB44RPWELZUSQLBQOAQ6LQ,2010-12-14 13:06:10,4,True,2010-12-14,13:06,"Appearex Biotin Tablets, 2.5 mg, 84-Count Box",Health & Household,Vitamins & Supplements
5,Wow! This is an amazing product for hair as well.,"I started taking this product on the recommendation of my dermatologist.  I went to her to talk about my continued hair loss. After my blood test results came back, I learned that I had very low blood stores (not anemia) and your body will typically shed whatever depletes your iron if it doesn't need it to survive.  She put me on an iron supplement; (Multigen Plus (prescription only) and suggested I also take 2 Appearex.  I've been taking 2 Multigen Plus and 2 Appearex biotin tablets everyday since August 2010, and I can't believe the new hair growth I've had.  It's incredible. I am truly amazed. The new growth is about 2 inches long now and it's all over my head.  I was able to see quite a bit of bare scalp before, and now, I have pretty great coverage all over!  Who knew...

4,worth a try,"I was skeptical when I made this purchase, because so many people advocate various ways to strengthen nails that simply don't work.  After all, your nails are basically dead.  If you can't improve the process that creates them, you're basically stuck with what you have.  Some products might help improve appearance somewhat or help prevent breakage, etc., but won't really improve the nail itself.  However, my dermatologist recommended this, so I decided to give it a try.  The bad thing is, you'll have to take a pill a day forever for lasting results, but it's not horribly expensive and I think many people would decide it's worth it.  I did actually think that my nails were a bit better after several month of taking this -- they had always grown fast but they weren't breaking as easily after taking the supplement for a while.  However, after about a half year of taking the supplement, I discovered I have a dairy allergy, and dairy is in the ingredient list, so I had to stop.  Therefore, I can't give you a long-standing personal account.  However, if you're at the end of your rope and think it's worth a try, I say go for it.  Just keep in mind that they advise that it takes several months (I don't remember the exact time frame) for results to appear because your nail has to grow out, so be prepared to give it time to work.",B000EBOOSO,B000EBOOSO,AHRVPRNLEJCQCX3PROXESKJ3HIYA,2011-09-12 01:32:02,0,True,2011-09-12,01:32,"Appearex Biotin Tablets, 2.5 mg, 84-Count Box",Health & Household,Vitamins & Supplements

It doesn't taste good, but if added to the right drink or food you can't taste it at all. I've even added it to my coffee. ;)  It lasts about a month depending on how much you use and how often.

5,This stuff really works on the hot flashes!!,"Once I started with menopause the hot flashes nearly drove me mad!  I tried all kinds of products, some with questionable herbs that could even be toxic.  None of it worked.  I was so so discouraged!  I started studying about all the natural remedies.  I didn't really want to go to the doctor and go on hormone replacement therapy, if she would have even agreed to it.  So I discovered that the soy isoflavones are kind of like a natural hormone replacement.  Yes, some folks take issue with that, but I figure if I'm one step away from pharmaceuticals, why not give it a try?  What I found was at first I had to take a lot of these tablets.  I took about 7 or 8 tablets a day split between morning and night.  Wow!  After a couple of weeks the hot flashes were almost gone and what little I had were very tolerable.  At first I found that I needed a high consistent dose and if I accidentally skipped a day I would know it!  That was a couple of years ago, and since then I have periodically tested reducing the number of tablets.  I think as my body is gradually adjusting to menopause the hot flashes have lessened a bit, which makes sense.  Now I take 3 tablets at night only.  My skin is supple and no accelerated aging, no vaginal dryness at all, and I feel half way sane and normal!

5,Serious about making a change?  This stuff rocks.,"If you are serious about changing your shape, size, and what makes up your shape and size, this stuff is an awesome addition.  For me, reducing my food intake slightly, kicking up exercise, and using this product really helped to tilt my metabolism toward burning off fat.  In the past, when I would just kick up exercise and pull back a bit on food, my body would hold stubbornly on its set point.  For me the Pyruvate made the decisive difference in getting weight and body composition moving the right direction.  (Although, in fairness, without focus on nutrition and exercise, I don't think it would be enough.  You have to be ready to change food and nutrition if you want to see the results you desire.

Just as beauty is in the eye of the beholder, palatabilty is a matter for the taster. This particular Genesis Today product for ACAI tastes like a very sweet/tart potent berry flavor candy. I don't notice a strange aftertaste or ""weird"" flavors. It simply tastes like a sweet tart fruit chew, similar to a small block of fruit roll-ups. Another reviewer mentions the orange, goji, and resveratrol flavors as awful, this product is the ACAI and IMO, tastes just great, my husband actually liked it too. Genesis Today actually has FIVE different superchews, perhaps there is one flavor among the five others will prefer over others, or not at all, a matter for each individual taster; remembering each different chew has different properties (mood, energy, cardiovascular, immune system, and joint health). I'm a registered nurse and love the energy/antioxidant properties this ACAI chew provides for me. I don't substitute this item for multivitamins, I take this product along with my daily multivitamin to ascertain my body is well armed with everything I feel it needs. For me, this chew is really tasty, almost like a candy treat and I get energy/antioxidant properties from it to boot, with less calories than a piece of chocolate !!",B00437UNEY,B00437UNEY,AFMBGLOQ4J4UV4RDTHDPMFHFFSZQ,2012-01-30 07:16:57,1,True,2012-01-30,07:16,"Genesis Today Acai Vitamin Super Chews, 30 Soft Chews",Health & Household,Vitamins & Supplements

5,Good and effective,"Please do your research before starting on a melatonin supplement. Here are a few pointers.<br />1) A small dose is better than large ones for sustained use.

This is why I use this.<br />3) From what I have read, taking a break from melatonin supplements for about 2 weeks every 4-6 weeks is a good idea. Try this if you feel the product is not effective anymore.<br />4) Pick up a bottle of sub-lingual melatonin in addition to this for those times when (a) you have forgotten to take the time release melatonin 30-60 mins before bedtime and are still wired, or have woken up in the middle of the night and cannot fall asleep.<br /><br />I am back to buy a second bottle of this product.",B00445HR3K,B00445HR3K,AEQBAFWPR3GQ72M3OE3URZQTR5IA,2012-11-20 18:01:20,4,True,2012-11-20,18:01,"Life Extension Melatonin Time Release 300mcg , 100 Capsule",Health & Household,Vitamins & Supplements

I don't even know what to compare it too because it doesn't taste like yogurt to me as this is a bit more sticky & thick. Also, there is not a dairy flavor either so that is why I cannot compare it to yogurt. I am so glad I listened to the sales rep at my local Vitamin Shoppe.

I drink this bad boy before I exercise because it's LOADED with everything your body needs to get through a tuff workout. You can drink this after as well but I usually find it hard because I don't carry a blender with me ;)<br /><br />Also I can't stress enough about using organic products, almost everything I buy is organic and frozen, or if it ain't frozen ..

5,"Great tasting, kids will take without issue.","Have this and the mango fish oil from Barleans. Both taste great with no oil taste. My kids, who are 5 and 7, take this without issue and the 7 year old views it as treat. I like the Barlean's products and with it being fall/winter here in MN it is a good time to order as they stay cool during most of their trip and when out in front of my door. Heat and light can have a big impact on omega's and I think being able to get the Barleans oils cold are a far better way to get your omegas then with pills sold on a shelf. I am an avid weight lifter and have always noticed a great benefit with supplementing with omega's and generally like to get them from both a fish and flax source at the same time. I am hoping the kids will reap the benefits as they grow and develop and these flavored oils are a great way to ensure they get them without complaint.

5,Cured my eczema,"I have suffered from severe hand eczema all my life. When I was a child, I received high doses of steroids, steroid creams, etc. Now I am 48 and my hands are permanently scarred from a lifetime of eczema. My dermatologist continued to prescribe steroid creams. I came across Dr. Andrew Weil's website and his advice on eczema, quote: ""Take gamma-linolenic acid (GLA). This unusual fatty acid is found in evening primrose oil, black currant oil and borage oil but is very hard to come by in the diet. GLA appears to have nourishing effects on skin, hair, and nails. Take 500 mg twice a day and expect to wait six to eight weeks to see results."" I had tried GLA before, but not in this high a dose, and I hadn't stuck with it for 2 months because I hadn't seen results soon enough. This time I started taking Barleans Total Omega Vegan Swirl (which has 510 mg. of GLA per serving). I swallowed one tablespoon at night and one in the morning. The taste is manageable--a little flaxseed aftertaste (not as tasty as some of the other Barleans swirl flavors, but the others don't have nearly as much GLA). After about two months, my hands started to spontaneously clear up. After about 6 months, my hands were completely healed. I can't believe that no doctor has told me about this, and that I had to wait so many years to find this rememedy! I now take just one TBS a night, and that seems to be good enough maintenance for me. This is a much better price than Whole Foods, where I recently purchased a bottle for almost $40 (I live in Hawaii).",B002VLZ8DU,B0BXQSMLXV,AGNWZNMPX4DFFQUN3GUWL4D7ECPQ,2012-07-04 19:29:11.000,55,True,2012-07-04,19:29,"Barlean's Strawberry Banana Flaxseed Oil Liquid, Vegan Omega 3 6 9 Supplements for Kids & Adults from Cold Pressed Flax Seed Oil with 2,968 mg of Vegan Omegas, Non-GMO & Gluten Free, 8 oz",Health & Household,Vitamins & Supplements
5,Tastes Yummy!,"Pros:<br />*Great taste & texture<br />*Fish-free (for vegans and others who don't consume fish)<br />*Sweetened w/ xylitol<br />*130 mg DHA, 1490 mg ALA, 400 mg GLA per serving<br /><br />Cons:<br />*I definitely got more DHA bang for my buck w/ the fish oils I'd buy before<br />*Doesn't have much EPA<br /><br />Before using this product, I was buying products made from fish for myself and my son (from Carlson & Nordic Naturals), but recently I had to switch my son from fish-derived oils since he has developed an allergy to fish. The flavor of the ones I'd buy were fine, but this is much, much better. It doesn't contain as much long-chain amino acids as some other fish-free supplements (like Ascenta NutraVege), but it's still very high in the omega 3 fatty acid ALA that can be converted in longer chain fatty acids. (To promote ALA's conversion to long-chain omega 3s, avoid excess linoleic acid [an omega 6 fatty acid], saturated fats, trans-fat, alcohol and caffeine consumption and consume adequate zinc, magnesium, selenium, B vitamin and vitamin C, which are  co-factors that aid the conversion.)

4,New Option,My sensitive stomach wasnt tolerating fish oil any more and i still vividly remember my experience years ago with plain flax oil....ugh i still shudder.

You still get that flax taste after you swallow but it doesnt stay hanging around on your tongue a quick sip of anything even water and its gone.

4,Good by Pricey,"I use this to help combat styes and chalazions. We heard that flaxseed oil (omega-3 source) can help prevent them. My daughter had several styes and a chalazion removed at age 4 and then had an active chalazion when we started her on this oil. Paired with warm compresses daily, the chalazion went away (it was hanging around for a long time). I go through a bottle a month so it is expensive but far less than cost of surgery. And we swear this oil helped heal the active chalazion. As an alternative, we sometimes mix organic flaxseed oil with kefir for the omega-3 blast.",B002VLZ8C6,B0BXQSMLXV,AH5VHMHCNTU3LXDF2EIEAJ76BIHA,2014-05-27 20:24:25.000,1,True,2014-05-27,20:24,"Barlean's Strawberry Banana Flaxseed Oil Liquid, Vegan Omega 3 6 9 Supplements for Kids & Adults from Cold Pressed Flax Seed Oil with 2,968 mg of Vegan Omegas, Non-GMO & Gluten Free, 8 oz",Health & Household,Vitamins & Supplements

5,A Modern Day Miracle for Me,"One reviewer has done us all the favor of doing the math to tell us this product is 50% water. Whether that's true or not is totally irrelevant to me because I have suffered with digestive issues my whole life and this product has been a miracle. My mother recently purchased 100% flax oil. I didn't think much of it and swallowed a tablespoon of it and had that awful taste in my mouth for almost 24 hours. So, I concluded that I'd much prefer to take just one tablespoon a day of this and marvel at how great it tastes and even more importantly how fantastically it has healed my digestive track. If you want 100% flax oil you may want to add it to some food that will literally cover up the taste and I'm not even sure if that's possible. Flax seeds on the other hand are easily added to a smoothy and leave no after taste. But this product has made it so convenient and so great tasting that I will use it as long as I live! Yes, it's that fantastic!",B00476B8U4,B0BXQSMLXV,AE377KCHUW3WGLC3Z5W5UQT6IT2Q,2016-05-15 14:05:27.000,4,True,2016-05-15,14:05,"Barlean's Strawberry Banana Flaxseed Oil Liquid, Vegan Omega 3 6 9 Supplements for Kids & Adults from Cold Pressed Flax Seed Oil with 2,968 mg of Vegan Omegas, Non-GMO & Gluten Free, 8 oz",Health & Household,Vitamins & Supplements

5,Hate the taste of oily fish? You'll love this if you have room in your fridge,"The Good: As a vegetarian, it seemed the only way I could get an omega supplement was from dead fish bits, but then I found this supplement and became hooked. The main source of omegas comes from flax seed oils, but you would barely notice from how nicely it tastes. I'm not about to drizzle this on my oatmeal in the morning, but it certainly is one of the tastier supplements I've tried. The mango flavor version is even better in my opinion. I have so much more energy after incorporating this into my daily routine, and I would recommend it to any non-vegetarians who hate the fishier versions.<br /><br />The Bad: This stuff is EXPENSIVE, and it doesn't help that it's hard to find this version outside expensive health stores, but one of these bottles has lasted me as many as 3 months with regular doses, and Amazon is offering it at a more affordable price than most.<br /><br />Pros:<br />-Great taste<br />-No fish<br />-An energy boost<br /><br />Cons:<br />-Expensive<br /><br />Buy again:<br />-Absolutely<br />If you have any questions about this product, feel free to message me.<br />*If this review has helped you in any way, [...] Thank you.*",B002VLZ8DU,B0BXQSMLXV,AGKOW7GAPUV2GRR4YN2WJ6ISLKYQ,2017-02-28 18:50:17.000,6,True,2017-02-28,18:50,"Barlean's Strawberry Banana Flaxseed Oil Liquid, Vegan Omega 3 6 9 Supplements for Kids & Adults from Cold Pressed Flax Seed Oil with 2,968 mg of Vegan Omegas, Non-GMO & Gluten Free, 8 oz",Health & Household,Vitamins & Supplements

It has a slight aftertaste, but I don't care because it isn't really unpleasant and it certainly doesn't have any trace of flax flavor.

5,Good stuff (added comment 11/21/22),"I’ve been buying this product for a long time at a local health food store, but its availability is very erratic. That store keeps it in a cooled cabinet, and I always assumed, as a result, that the product had to be chilled at all times. Found out I was wrong and that the refrigeration is only necessary AFTER it has been opened. So, I will buy this regularly here on Amazon now. An added bonus I see is that the expiration date on the one I just got from Amazon is MUCH further away than the bottles I buy at the health food store (so far, anyway).<br />11/21/22 - I see a major typo describing this product now.

5,Weird but tasty—and better purchased in the store,"This was recommended to me by a dietician late last year. It's a bit spendy, but much better than buying the fish-oil pills and putting up with fishy burps all day.<br /><br />I like to put my teaspoon's worth in my morning oatmeal, but it tastes good by itself. It may actually taste too good—it's tempting to have an extra spoonful or two, with the result being that a bottle doesn't last as long as it should. But again, it's better than putting up with that fishy taste from fish-oil pills.<br /><br />I recommend not purchasing online, however. My order from Amazon arrived in one of those plastic envelopes with the bubble-wrap lining; this offered next to no protection of the contents. When I opened the package, the cap was cracked, and the seal had been punctured. Fortunately, Whole Foods is just a block away, so I was able to return it with no problem.

They should definitely stop producing this flavor, as it does not mask the fishy taste or smell like the Orange Creme one does.<br /><br />If the Orange Creme is ever out of stock again, I would rather not have any at all than to get this flavor again.

5,Delicious and no fish taste at all!,"ALL of the Barlean’s Omega Liquids are FABULOUS! My sister told me that my nieces and nephew loved to take this and I ordered some for myself and my kids. I’ve always wanted to take Omega, but I despise the fish taste. I’ve taken pills before that said “no fish taste!” And I still had a fish taste in my mouth an hour later. Y’all...these do not tase like fish AT ALL. They taste exactly like what each flavor says. We have tried 4 flavors at this point and my kids really do love them as much as I do! I will say that I think these are super expensive, and there are some months where I really just don’t have the extra money to spend on this. I wish the coat was in the $18 range. Some flavors of these are almost $30 or more, and that’s ridiculous to me.

5,This is a GREAT addion to a senior's diet!,"This is an addition to a healthy 95 year olds diet. It promotes her normal personality and I call it 'HAPPY JUICE'! She gives herself permission to laugh with her friends and be happy. It's probably filling a deficiency in her diet somewhere. She does not like fish.<br />In this age group, they naturally eat less (volume). And often long time friends die on a weekly basis. Thus, it's too easy to be depressed. Help your senior smell the roses and enjoy life!",B002VLZ8DU,B0BXQSMLXV,AFF3B2TCIIEGNTBSYCXEKBVILAJA,2023-07-28 21:48:57.001,6,True,2023-07-28,21:48,"Barlean's Strawberry Banana Flaxseed Oil Liquid, Vegan Omega 3 6 9 Supplements for Kids & Adults from Cold Pressed Flax Seed Oil with 2,968 mg of Vegan Omegas, Non-GMO & Gluten Free, 8 oz",Health & Household,Vitamins & Supplements
